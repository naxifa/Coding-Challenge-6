# Coding-Challenge-6

In this challenge, I will create a simple employee shift management system for a small business. The system will track employee shift schedules, check availability, assign shifts, and calculate total hours worked for each employee. Iâ€™ll use objects to represent employees and shifts, arrays to store multiple employees and shift schedules, and array/object methods to manipulate the data.
